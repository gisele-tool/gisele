DESCRIPTION
  The Gisele process analyzer toolset provides tools and technique to model and analyze
  complex process models such as care processes.

  When --ast is used, the command parses a process file and prints its Abstract Syntax
  Tree (AST) on standard output. By default, this option prints the AST for manual
  debugging, that is with colors and extra information. Use --ast=ruby to get a ruby
  array for automatic processing.

  When --no-sugar is specified, syntactic sugar is first removed before making any other
  transformation. For now, this rewrites all `if` statements as explicit `case` guarded
  commands.
