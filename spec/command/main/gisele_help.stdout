DESCRIPTION
  The Gisele process analyzer toolset provides tools and technique to model and analyze
  complex process models such as care processes.

  When --ast is used, the command parses a process file and prints its Abstract Syntax
  Tree (AST) on standard output. By default, this option prints the AST for manual
  debugging, that is with colors and extra information. Use --ast=ruby to get a ruby
  array for automatic processing.

SystemExit
