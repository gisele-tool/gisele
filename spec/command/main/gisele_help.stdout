DESCRIPTION
  The Gisele process analyzer toolset provides tools and technique to model and analyze
  complex process models such as care processes.

  When --no-sugar is specified, syntactic sugar is first removed before making any other
  transformation. For now, this rewrites all `if` statements as explicit `case` guarded
  commands.

  When --ast is used, the command parses the process file and prints its Abstract Syntax
  Tree (AST) on standard output. By default, this option prints the AST for manual
  debugging, that is with colors and extra information. Use --ast=ruby to get a ruby
  array for automatic processing.

  When --graph is used, the command parses the process file. It then converts the AST into
  a directed graph representing the process as a box-and-arrow workflow and outputs it on
  standard output. For now, the only output format available is dot (from graphviz).

SystemExit
